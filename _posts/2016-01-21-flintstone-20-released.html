<p>Changes include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Major refactor, class names have changed and the whole codebase is much more extensible</li>
    <li>Removed the static <code>load</code> and <code>unload</code> methods and the <code>FlinstoneDB</code> class</li>
    <li>The <code>replace</code> method is no longer public</li>
    <li>The <code>getFile</code> method has been removed</li>
    <li>Default swap memory limit has been increased to 2MB</li>
    <li>Ability to pass any instance for cache that implements <code>Flintstone\Cache\CacheInterface</code></li>
</ul>
