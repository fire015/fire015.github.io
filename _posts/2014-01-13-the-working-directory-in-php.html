<p>A colleague recently came to me with this issue that worked fine in their browser, but not on the command line:</p>

<p><code>Warning: include(../config.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory</code></p>

<p>This warning appeared because of the current working directory.</p>

<p>When accessing this script via the browser, Apache found the correct path to the file and so '../' was relative to it's own directory.</p>

<p>However by running it from a command line...</p>

<p><code>php /var/www/public/index.php</code></p>

<p>The current working directory was actually wherever the user is in the file system of the server.</p>

<p>In which case they could do:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
cd /var/www/public/
php index.php
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Better yet, they could use the <code>__DIR__</code> magic constant in PHP which returns the directory of the file itself.</p>

{% highlight php %}

<?php
include(__DIR__ . '/../config.php');

{% endhighlight %}

<p>If you ever need to figure out the current working directory, you can use the nifty function <a href="http://php.net/getcwd">getcwd()</a>.</p>
