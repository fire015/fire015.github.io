<p>Something that took me a while to figure out was how to drag a marker on a map to a new position and then retrieve it's lat/lng (version 3).</p>

<p>This assumes you have the <em>map</em> variable set as an instance of google.maps.Map and <em>latlng</em> which is the current position to show on the map as an instance of google.maps.LatLng.</p>


{% highlight javascript %}

var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
	map: map,
	draggable: true,
	position: latlng
});

google.maps.event.addListener(marker, 'dragend', function(){
	var position = marker.getPosition();
	map.setCenter(position); // set the map center to it's new position
	alert(position.lat() + ',' + position.lng()); // here are the new lat/lng strings
});

{% endhighlight %}
