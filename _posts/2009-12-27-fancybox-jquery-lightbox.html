<p><a href="http://fancybox.net/">FancyBox</a> is a tool for displaying images, html content and multi-media in a modal window (lightbox) based on the jQuery library.</p>

<p>What I love about FancyBox is loading new windows in an iframe. For example one website that I built used the <a href="https://rpxnow.com/">RPX</a> system allowing users to log in via their favorite social networking site. Rather than just redirect users to the RPX page I had it load in a modal window so they were never taken away from my site.</p>


{% highlight javascript %}

$(document).ready(function(){
	$('a.iframe').fancybox({
		'frameURL': 'https://XX.rpxnow.com/openid/embed?token_url=XX',
		'frameHeight': 280,
		'hideOnContentClick': false
	});
});

{% endhighlight %}
