<p>I find it frustrating getting into London these days as there are always problems on the tube that causes delays.</p>

<p>To take action we have launched a new service dubbed "Tweet the Tube" which provides live updates whenever a tube service changes status, pulled straight from the Transport for London website and checked every 5 minutes.</p>

<p>All you have to do is follow "tweetthetube" on twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/tweetthetube">http://twitter.com/tweetthetube</a></p>

<p>Feel free to leave comments/suggestions on <a href="/tweet-the-tube/">this page</a>.</p>
